    <h1>Fried Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../img/fried-chicken.jpg">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every inch of this crust is insanely crunchy, and there’s loads of those nubbly bits that get extra crunchy. The seasoning is satisfyingly spot on – strong but not outrageously overpowering – the buttermilk marinated flesh is tender and juicy all the way through, and the deep golden colour is sheer perfection.</p>
    <p>Seriously, what kind of human being could resist a piping hot pile of freshly made fried chicken?? {Vegetarians are excused}</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1.8 kg/ 3.6lb bone in, skin on small thighs (< 200g/7oz), drumsticks, whole wings, breast (< 200g/7oz)</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>2 1/4 cups flour </li>
        <li>3/4 cup corn flour / cornstarch</li>
        <li>3 tsp salt</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp celery salt</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>3 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp mustard powder</li>
        <li>3/4 tsp ginger powder</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp dried thyme</li>
        <li>1.5 tsp dried oregano</li>
        <li>1.5 - 2 litres / quarts vegetable oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix Marinade in a bowl until salt dissolves.</li>
        <li>Pour over chicken in ziplock bag, massage to coat chicken. Press out excess air, seal, refrigerate 12 to 24 hours, turning once or twice.</li>
        <li>Pour chicken and marinade into large bowl.</li>
        <li>Whisk together Breading and all KFC Secret Herbs & Spices.</li>
        <li>Drizzle 4.5 tablespoons of Marinade into flour mixture. Use fingers to rub in so you get lots of pea sized lumpy bits all throughout (this creates extra super crunchy craggy bits).</li>
        <li>Spread out in a shallow dish or pan (easier to work with).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 80°C/175°F and place rack on tray - to keep chicken warm.</li>
        <li>Add oil to a wide, heavy based pot to a depth of 6 cm / 2.5 " (my 26cm/10.5" cast iron pot = 1.75L/quarts oil,</li>
        <li>Heat oil over medium to medium high heat to 180°C/350°F - maintain temp as best you can</li>
        <li>Cooking order: Start with thighs and drumsticks, wings next and cook breast last</li>
        <li>Squidge a piece of chicken in remaining marinade, place in flour.</li>
        <li>Coat well, pressing very firmly to adhere. Transfer to plate.</li>
        <li>Once chicken is in, oil temperature should drop to 150°C/300°C - adjust heat to target this.</li>
        <li>DO NOT TOUCH chicken for 2 minutes - to let the crust bond with the chicken skin. After this, you can move them around but oil should be deep enough that you do not need to flip (but you can if you want!).</li>
        <li>Thighs and drumsticks - cook for 8 minutes (wings for 5 minutes), or until deep golden brown and internal temperature at thickest part is 75°C / 167°F.</li>
        <li>Breast - fry for 6 minutes or until internal temperature at thickest part is 65°C / 150°F (time depends on size).</li>
        <li>Place onto rack and keep warm in oven. Repeat with remaining chicken, coating each batch just prior to cooking.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately!</li>
        <li>Classic sides: Coleslaw, KFC copycat potato and gravy, steamed or grilled corn, cornbread or soft rolls, fries, potato salad, Southern Baked Beans!</li>
    </ol>
